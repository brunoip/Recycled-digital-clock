# Recycled digital clock
This project was born because I wanted to repair a broken digital clock that I had but the custom IC that was used for the logic and control was hard to find so I decided to make all the electronics again using an arduino pro micro.
The printed piece where made in order to help keep the new boards in place and may not be useful when using a different brand of clock, however I noticed the this type of displays are widely ussedd across difference brands.
